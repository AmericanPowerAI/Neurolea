# Neurolea - Zero Dependencies AI Framework
# This file is intentionally empty!
# 
# Unlike other AI frameworks, Neurolea requires ZERO external dependencies.
# No PyTorch, no NumPy, no Transformers library - just pure Python!
# 
# Your old requirements.txt probably looked like:
# torch>=2.0.0          <- REPLACED by our AcceleratedTensor
# transformers>=4.30.0  <- REPLACED by our UltimateLanguageModel  
# tokenizers>=0.13.0    <- REPLACED by our SentencePieceTokenizer
# numpy>=1.26.4         <- REPLACED by our pure Python math operations
#
# Now you just need:
# python>=3.8
#
# That's it! 🎉
